    <br>
    <p>Health is one of the most important basic human rights, and the Conservatives will always try to improve it in any way possible. The current Scottish NHS (National Health Service) is one of the best in the world, but we believe there is always room for improvement, and have plans to improve it even more. Firstly, we will employ around 10 000 more doctors and nurses, and this will have a huge impact, as this will mean more specialised care, and much faster emergency care when you need it. This will ensure that you get exactly the medical care you need, when you need it. Furthermore, these new NHS jobs will also reduce the unemplyment rate.</p>
