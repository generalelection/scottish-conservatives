    <p>Liam P. McLaughlin has been chosen as the candidate for the election to the Scottish Parliament for the Scottish Conservative Unionist Party (Scottish Conservatives). </p>
    <p>Liam P. McLaughlin will be an excellent choice for the voters as he has lots of experience and skills. Ms Mila Radosavljevic, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said "I think Liam P. McLaughlin will be an excellent MSP because he really cares about our local community, and I hope voters will choose him as their elected representative."</p>
    <p>Some of the issues Liam P. McLaughlin will be campaigning about include a better life for the people of Edinburgh South, ans to increase spending on public services such as the NHS, police, and the fire department.</p>
    <p>However, the most important issue is education, and we want to bring the Scottish education system back to how it was a few years ago: among the best in the world. As our candidate says, "We need to put Scottish education back into the 21st century, and with our planned funding for schools and our goal to put free WiFi across our cities, we will achive this goal. Also, we will ensure that private companies answer for neglecting the maintenance of our schools that have directly led to the death of one girl in Edinburgh. This is disgusting that private companies are able to get away with this."</p>
    <p>Liam P. McLaughlin will be giving a speech at James Gillespie's High School on 1 June 2016, and hopes that people will come along and listen. "This is your chance to listen and make an informed choice about who you think will be the best person to represent you. I promise I will do the best I can to get things done for the people of Edinburgh South", said Sai Raghu Neelothpal Saraswatibhatla.</p>
