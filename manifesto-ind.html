    <br>
    
    <p>The Conservatives firmly object to a second referendum. We unconditionally believe that leaving the UK is a bad idea as the people of Scotland have spoken and have said "NO" to independence. We should respect this decision and preserve the informed and knowledgeable majority that has the common sense to know what is best for Scotland.</p>
