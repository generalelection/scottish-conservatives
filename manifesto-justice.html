    <p>We believe that crime prevention and justice are key to a successful economy and country, as citizens can go about their daily activities without fear. We are going to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce prison sentences of a maximum of three months as an alternative to community service.</li>
      <li>Make community sentences tougher, with offenders carrying out jobs like litter picking, snow shovelling, and beach cleaning.</li>
      <li>Pilot a community court in Glasgow.</li>
      <li>Use cash seized from criminals to help victims of crime.</li>
      <li>End automatic early release from prison.</li>
      <li>Introduce mandatory drug tests for all inmates on arrival to and departure from prison.</li>
      <li>Oblige police services to release monthly local crime figures and maps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, we also have plans against terrorism and extremism, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New banning orders for extremist groups.</li>
      <li>Introducing extremism disruption orders for those who "spread poison".</li>
      <li>Restoring police and agencies' access to communications data they need to fight terrorism and organised crime.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With these steps, we believe that we can bring crime and terrorism/extremism under control.</p>
