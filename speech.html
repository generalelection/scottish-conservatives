    <br>
    <p>Good morning/afternoon. I am Liam P. McLaughlin and I am the candidate or the Scottish Conservative Unionist Party (Scottish Conservative Party). I am standing for election to the Scottish Parliament. There are many reasons that I feel I would make an excellent MSP.</p>
    <p>I have good personal qualities. I am open-minded and I will be sure to take any sensible and/or popular opinions and suggestions to parliament, even if I disagree with them myself. <!--I am good at being a Liam.--></p>
    <p>Also, I have the support of my party, the Scottish Conservative party.</p>
    <p>If I am elected, I will work extremely hard for you, the constituents of Edinburgh South. There are several issues which I feel need to be addressed and I would try my best to solve these issues if I was an MSP.</p>
    <p>The most important issue is our education system, and I would try to make this better by reintroducing old education schemes, and spending much more on technology in schools.</p>
    <p>Another issue I would focus on would be our economy, which has been destroyed over the past ten years under the Sturgeon-led government. I would work towards reviving the economy by spending more on job creation and spending less on less important issues such as the Trident nuclear scheme, on which £2.4 billion is spent every year.</p>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote for me, Liam P. McLaughlin, in the elections to the Scottish Parliament. I will try my very best to make sure things are changed for the better when I am in the Scottish Parliament. <!--Vote for me on Election Day and you won't be disappointed! By the way, look at our website and try the Konami Code on it because we are awesome and we know you are awesome and it works!!! (Insert Smiley Face Here)--></p>
