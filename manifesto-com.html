    <p>As you may know, many town centres are in desperate need of funding. Town centres are at the hearts of communities; neglecting them is essentially neglecting that community itself. The Conservatives hope to put £30 million into town centres, to help revitalise them.</p>
    <p>The Conservatives also hope to improve Scottish roads. Roads in Scotland are covered in potholes, which need to be filled in. Many stretches of road also need to be redone. We hope to spend £20 million on improving the A82. A75, and the A90.</p>
