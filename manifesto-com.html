    <p>As you may know, many town centres are in desperate need of funding. Town centres are at the hearts of communities; neglecting them is essentially neglecting that community itself. The Conservatives hope to put £30 million into town centres, to help revitalise them.</p>
    <p>The Conservatives also hope to improve Scottish roads. Roads in Scotland are covered in potholes, which need to be filled in. Many stretches of road also need to be redone. We hope to spend £20 million on improving the A82, A75, and the A90.</p>
    <p>The Conservatives want to build more affordable housing - for everyone. We believe that having a roof over everyone's head will help us build a stronger community. The Conservatives hope to create a long-term scheme for Scottish affordable housing.</p>
    <p>As many will agree, the Internet has become an important part of our lives. It is used in our homes, in our wokplaces, and in our schools. The Conservatives hope to put £400 million into improving broadband, and hopefully fibre optic, for everyone by 2020.</p>
